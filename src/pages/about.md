I'm Jon. I am a father, husband, brother, friend, runner, video game player, web developer, and much more. I am also someone who has struggled with weight loss, keeping the weight off, and portion control. I am in my mid 40's with an adult-child (wait that doesn't sound right) and two young children under the age of 7 (as of this writing).

As I have aged I have realized that eating bacon, eggs, and cheese every day (low-carb diet) as a way to stay trim(ish) was not a healthy, long term, plan that ends with me meeting my grandchildren. As such, my research lead me land upon, not a diet, but more a set of guideline for eating called
<a href="https://www.bluezones.com/" target="_blank">The Blue Zones.</a>

I am starting the blog around the same time I am changing the way I eat and think about food with the hopes of documenting it - the good and the bad - and making it available to anyone else who might find value in it.

I have found the Blue Zones is great as a set of guidelines and ideas on how to approach eating for long term health. Ulitmately this lead to my decision to apply these basic concepts to veganism (I don't like ism's generally speaking) and have found this is working well for me.

| **_My Resume_** | My resume. I attempted to make it look as much like a Word Document as possible. This was made using Svelte.                                                                          | <a href="https://resume.jonellwood.dev" target="_blank">Link</a>   |
| **_Projects_**  | This is a little Svelte page I put together when learning Svelte. I keep it almost 100% becuase I like the 3D effect of the cloud background and the font and color changing feature. | <a href="https://projects.jonellwood.dev" target="_blank">Link</a> |
